A bit is a binary digit- a zero or a one, which is a base 2 system

Computers use binary systems- two bits- 0 and 1 to represent information.

we basically have transistors in our computers, which have 0 or 1 (on or off) and we have millions of them that store information.


we use base 10 in our decimal system. each digit can only be 0-9- or 10 numbers.

in our decimal system each value is in tens, hundreds, thousands, or in powers of ten.

likewise in binary, its in powers of 2. ones place is 2^1
tens place is 2^2 and so on and so forth. this is because in decimal the possibilities are 0-9 (10) for each digit so its in powers of 10 but in binary it can only be on or off, as in 0 or 1- only two, so 2^1, 2^2 etc

we use a byte of bits cuz bits are too small. one byte has 8 bits inside of it. so 

2^8 + 2^7 and so on, so you can count til 255 using one byte.

computers can only use zeros and ones (binary) but we can still use them to get alphabets using ASCII characters we assign numbers to each alphabets to get the characters.

therefore, A is 01000001 or 65. B is 66, C is 67 and so on. for lowercase, it starts from 97, then B is 98 and so on. 

this is ASCII- American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

they allocated only 8 bits total for representing letters, numbers and punctuation symbols too. this means we can only represent 256 different characters in a computer. so we cant represent all languages in it, but only english is possible.

so unicode is basically a newer standard code of ASCII- with 8-16 bytes which the end goal is to be compatible with ASCII, so the first byte is synonymous with it but it adds every language, emojis and etc.

emojis too have their own binary code that are just a code that expresses a character and there's a drawing of an emoji on it which is an emoji. which explains why its different on every app or every device.

Every dot on the screen is a pixel and every pixel has an assigned RGB value to it, ie three different values, a binary value with R, with G and one with B. each of them will have something like 001010010 or something and the value of it say if its 73 then the intensity of the light will be something like 73/255 (total possibilities of binary numbers in a bit.) 

So, 1 megabyte is 1 x 10^6 bytes or 8 x 10 ^6 bits.

A video is not continuous motion, it is just like a flip book, like 30 fps or 30 images per second really really fast. That's why videos are so large they have images inside them.

And each number in the computer correlates to a certain frequency, pitch, volume, duration, instrument etc. kinda like RGB, this is stored by a few bytes. 

At the end of the day its taking in zeros and ones (binary) and then processing it and then converting it back to human language and teaches it to us.

Algorithms are a step by step, finite set of instructions designed to solve a specific program or task. 

A function is an action or a verb- a task that a computer can do for you.

If, else, else-if are conditions, are used to evaulate a condition and return a boolean value depending on the condition.

A boolean expression is a question with True or False answers (binary).
