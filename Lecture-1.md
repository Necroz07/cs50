A bit is a binary digit- a zero or a one, which is a base 2 system

Computers use binary systems- two bits- 0 and 1 to represent information.

we basically have transistors in our computers, which have 0 or 1 (on or off) and we have millions of them that store information.


we use base 10 in our decimal system. each digit can only be 0-9- or 10 numbers.
